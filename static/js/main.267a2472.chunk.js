This is to get them familiar with navigating the landscape and noting landmarks. It is only after this step that a newbie is given the map to handle.

It would certainly be interesting to think how players might navigate a region with just a map with no indication of where the player is located on that map. This concept could tie into the whole aspect of vision occlusion being a major factor in gameplay and how players must learn how to deal with the Uncertainty while navigating snowy terrain.','How would players "orient" themselves in the VR world? Would they die more often if they let their arrogance get the better of them? Would they even rely on a map to begin with? These questions constantly nag me to no end, and I honestly just want to start experimenting with Unity already (if only work allowed me to...).
