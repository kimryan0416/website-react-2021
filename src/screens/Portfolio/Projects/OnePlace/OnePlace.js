				<h4><strong>Description</strong></h4>
				<Divider space={8} />
				<p>"OnePlace" initially started out as a Startup Studio venture from Cornell Tech between four colleagues, as part of CT's 2019-2020 studio-based master's degree. United by the idea of helping families share important documents online, the four of us wished to ultimately change how families interacted with each other online and how they cooperated to share critical information using the latest web technology.</p>
				<Divider space={8} />
				<p>I joined the project, originally coined "Software for Families," as the lead front-end engineer. I was responsible for designing and building out a user interface that would satisfy both tech-savvy millenials and older potential users who may not be as experienced in web technologies.</p>
				<Divider space={8} />
				<p> It was an interesting challenge and concept, and I quickly grew fond of the idea of engendering positive change by helping families adapt to modern conventions of file-sharing and communication while encouraging safe practices when using the Internet.</p>
