				<h3>Tucan Fitness – Lead UX Developer and Front-End Engineer</h3>
				<Divider space={16} />
				<h4><strong>Description</strong></h4>
				<Divider space={8} />
				<p>I was largely responsible for helping the Tucan Fitness front-end development team update their existing user interface and introduce UX Design concepts into their development process.</p>
				<Divider space={8} />
				<p>While on this project, I spearheaded the design process by teaching TF’s core staff and developers about how to integrate user interview findings into key feature sets. I also acted as the platform’s primary front-end developer, working closely together with the team’s back-end engineers to add new functions and update outdated processes.</p>

				<h4><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong></h4>
				<Divider space={8} />
				<p>While I had provided consultation and development services in the past, this was the first time my consultation extended beyond front-end coding and into UX Design practices. This meant I had to employ different tactics to understand the needs of TF’s core team and guide them towards a development process geared towards UX-oriented practices.</p>

				<p>Some key takeaways from this experience were:</p>

						<h6><strong>Gains:</strong></h6>
						<Divider space={8} />
 						<ul className="h7">
							<li>Quickly got developers and designers in the team to adapt to UX-specific practices such as empathy maps, personas, and wireframes</li>
							<li>Became familiar with team leader responsibilities by delegating tasks to appropriate personnel, leading management-level changes in the team’s development cycle, and encouraging documentation of front-end code to discover redundancies and disparities in code structure.</li>
							<li>Successfully employed UX Design practices to discover issues in the web app’s user experience and identify user needs that were previously undiscovered.</li>
						</ul>

					<div className="PortfolioContentColumn">
						<h6><strong>Obstacles:</strong></h6>
						<Divider space={8} />
						<ul className="h7">
							<li>Remote teamwork often led to a lack of communication and transparency between team members, which sometimes hindered our work ethic.</li>
							<li>A rapid Agile UX design process, while beneficial in identifying user needs and pains, sometimes moved too quickly to allow for group collaboration on code, instead forcing one or two developers to spearhead changes and preventing the team from documenting changes. This could have been avoided through careful note taking during both meetings and development scrums to provide overviews on progress and upcoming tasks.</li>
							<li>Code documentation was neglected for much of the process until much later in the development cycle.</li>
