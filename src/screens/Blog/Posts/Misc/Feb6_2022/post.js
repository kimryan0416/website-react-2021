		"Hello! This is technically the \"first\" blog post here, but this is now a personal blog section of the website. I used to have another blog website, \"SimpleDevs\", where I intended to post anything related to gaming there. However, the process of logging into BlueHost (the service provider for my old website) and then logging into WordPress from there was too tedious. I felt it was better to migrate the blog content there and post here. Kind of like my own personal place for reflections.",
		"I used to have a subscription service on that old blog site, but I am unsure if I will add it here. I hate to be pessimistic, but I doubt there will be many people actively looking for my blog stuff anyways.",

				<>
					<span>This will mostly be a place where I </span>
					<strong>OCCASIONALLY</strong>
					<span> will post about musings, work, research, and gaming. No real special bells or whistles.</span>
				</>
			)
		},
		"Getting the blog part of this website up was definitely a hassle though. It was a challenge to set up a system where I can type efficiently without resorting to weird syntax (or worse, XML) to provide the proper text formatting... but it was a good challenge. And now there's most definitely a system that I can rely on and remember upon returning back to this part of my website after long spouts.",
		"Though, I do feel like I am procrastinating a TAD bit."
